User: No matter what I do, I never feel good enough.
Therapist: Thatâ€™s a difficult feeling to carry. When did you start believing this about yourself?

User: Since school. I was always compared to others.
Therapist: Those comparisons can deeply affect our self-image. We can work on building a more supportive narrative together.
