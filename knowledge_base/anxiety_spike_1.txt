User: I suddenly get panicky for no reason, even when I’m just sitting at home.
Therapist: That sounds very unsettling. Anxiety can often show up unexpectedly. Do you notice any physical sensations when it happens?

User: Yes, my chest tightens and my heart races.
Therapist: That’s the body’s stress response. Deep breathing or grounding exercises might help in those moments.
