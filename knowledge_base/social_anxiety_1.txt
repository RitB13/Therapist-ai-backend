User: I get nervous even before saying hello to someone new.
Therapist: Social anxiety can feel incredibly limiting. What are you most afraid will happen in those moments?

User: That I’ll say something stupid and they’ll judge me.
Therapist: That fear is valid, but also challengeable. We can work on reframing those beliefs and practicing gentle exposure.
