User: I can't stop crying ever since my grandmother passed away. It's like a part of me is gone.
Therapist: I'm truly sorry for your loss. Grief can come in waves, and itâ€™s okay to feel overwhelmed. Would you like to talk about what she meant to you?

User: She raised me. She was like a second mother.
Therapist: That bond sounds incredibly special. Holding on to those memories can be painful but also healing.
